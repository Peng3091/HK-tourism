        "description": "Hong Kong has taken a significant step towards environmental sustainability. Starting from 22 April 2024, restaurants and merchants will no longer provide disposable plastic tableware such as straws, cutlery, cups, and takeaway containers. We are also putting an end to the free distribution of plastic products in hotel rooms. With the use of plant-based alternatives and reducing plastic waste, we can make a positive impact on our environment and ensure the long-term well-being of our city. ",
